                <p>A new report from the World Health Organization 

                    (WHO) highlights that 2.6 million deaths per year 
                    
                    were attributable to alcohol consumption, 
                    
                    accounting for 4.7% of all deaths, and 0.6 million 
                    
                    deaths to psychoactive drug use. Notably, 2 million 
                    
                    of alcohol and 0.4 million of drug-attributable 
                    
                    deaths were among men.
                    
                    The report highlights the urgent need to accelerate 
                    
                    actions globally towards achieving Sustainable 
                    
                    Development Goal (SDG)  target 3.5 by 2030 by 
                    
                    reducing alcohol and drug consumption and 
                    
                    improving access to quality treatment for 
                    
                    substance use disorders.
                    
                    Some 724 000 deaths were due to injuries, such as 
                    
                    those from traffic crashes, self-harm and 
                    
                    interpersonal violence. Another 284 000 deaths 
                    
                    were linked to communicable diseases
                    
                    Globally, 23.5% of all 15–19 year olds were current 
                    
                    drinkers. Rates of current drinking were highest 
                    
                    among 15–19-year-olds in the European region 
                    
                    (45.9%) followed by the Americas (43.9%).
